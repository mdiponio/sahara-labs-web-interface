this with the location of the extracted source. 

<VirtualHost *:80>

   # This should be omitted in the production environment
   SetEnv APPLICATION_ENV development
    
   <Directory "<ROOT>/public">
       Options Indexes MultiViews FollowSymLinks
       AllowOverride All

Permission Keys
=================================
Please consult the README in the PermissionKeys folder.

Setting Up Custom Rig Type Pages
================================
In the folder institution/<Configured institution>/scripts/ add a file
with the script <Rig Type Name>.phtml. This will then be rendered for
session pages of for rigs with that rig type. For example:

Institution: UTS
Rig Type: Coupled_Tanks
Rendered page: institution/UTS/Coupled_Tanks.phtml.

If no rig type script is provided, a default script is used which
assumes a Remote Desktop style rig type.

NOTE: Documentation has been written with details of how to develop
rig type pages, in collaboration with developing rig clients.

Setting Up Custom Information Pages
===================================
To set up institution specific information pages i.e. News, FAQ, Contact
Us and Laboratory Information pages that use the default template but 
contain institute specific information.

In the folder institution/<Configured institution>/ add a file
with the name <information Type>.php eg Contacts.php or LabInfo.php. 
This will set up the information to be displayed on the page.

Include the following information:
CONTACT US: Create an associative array which contains 
	role => contact information.  
  The contact information is again an associative array with any 
  key => value pair that should be displayed (they will be displayed 
  in a table as field => value).
FAQ: The structure is list of associative arrays which contain the 
  key value pairs:
	question => question text
	answer =>  answer text
  Any links or editing must have the html mark up included.
NEWS: The structure is list of associative arrays which contain the  
  key value pairs:
	header => News item header text
	info  =>  News item information
  Any links or editing must have the html mark up included.
LABORATORY INFORMATION: For similar gallery style presentation, 
  this script should have a list of arrays with each array containing
  the information for the image. 
  The image information is an associative array containing:
    filename => image filename (from baseUrl)
    alt => subtitle for image
    title => title for image


If no rig type institute specific content is provided, the default information 
is used.

NOTE: There are example scripts in docs/InfoExamples.  
Additional documentation has been written with details of how to develop
these pages, in collaboration with developing rig clients.
