Setting SimpleSAMLphp with the Australian Access Federation
===========================================================

This guide gives basic instructions on how to setup 
SimpleSAMLphp with the Australian Access Federation (AAF).

  * Details about the AAF can be found at
    http://www.aaf.edu.au/
  * More in depth documentation of SimpleSAMLphp can be found
    at http://simplesamlphp.org/docs/1.8/
    
The requirements for SimpleSAMLphp are PHP 5.2+, with modules:
 
  * date
  * dom
  * hash
  * libxml
  * openssl
  * pcre
  * SPL
  * zlib
  * mcrypt

It is expected the web server SimpleSAMLphp is installed to is the same as the
SAHARA Labs WI server. Using a different server has not been tested and may
not work. Further this assumes the installation is on a UNIX like operating
system and may not work

  1. Download SimpleSAMLphp from http://simplesamlphp.org/download

  2. Set up a virtual directory for hosting SimpleSAMLphp with the directory 
     '/simplesaml'. Sample configuration to do this is:
     
Alias /simplesaml /var/simplesamlphp/www
<Directory /var/simplesamlphp/www >
    order deny,allow
    allow from all 
</Directory>

  3. Restart the Apache server.
  
  4. Unpack the dowloaded SimpleSAMLphp package to '/var/'.
  
  5. Rename the extracted folder from simplesamlphp-<version> to
     simplesamlphp.
  
  6. Open 'http://<address>/simplesaml'. This should display the SimpleSAML 
     installation page.
   
  7. Open '/var/simplesamlphp/config/config.php' and edit the properties:
  
     * auth.adminpassword => Administrator password
     * secretsalt => A salt for generated hashes
     * technicalcontact_name => Name of the administrator
     * technicalcontact_email => Email address of the administrator
     * timezone => Timezone of the server
      
  8. Copy the file '/var/simplesamlphp/modules/sanitycheck/config-templates/config-sanitycheck.php'
     to '/var/simplesamlphp/config'.
   
  9. On the SimpleSAMLphp installation page, select the 'Configuration'
     tab and perform all the listed diagnostics. Once logged in the page
     will display whether all the required PHP modules are installed.
     
 10. Enable the 'consent' and 'metarefresh' modules by:
      
       => touch /var/simplesamlphp/modules/consent/enable
       => touch /var/simplesamlphp/modules/metarefresh/enable
       
 11. Generate a self signed certificate which is used to encypt messages within
     the AAF. The following sub-steps walk through certificate generation.
