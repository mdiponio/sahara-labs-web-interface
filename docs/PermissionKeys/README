Permission Keys
===============

Permissions keys allow a logged in user to persent a 'key' that allows them to
be authorised as a member of a user class. This accomodates for the inability
of Single Sign On systems to properly authorise users.

Permission keys are composed of:

   * actual key (64 characters) - the actual key strings that the user is 
       to provide when redeeming the key
   * user class - the class that the user is assigned to when the permission
       key is redeemed.
   * remaining_uses - the number of uses the permission key is active for
   * home_org (optional) - a possible home organisation as supplied by
       Shibboleth
   * affliation (optional) - a possible affliation (such as staff) as provided
       by Shibboleth
       
To enabling permission keys:

  1. Apply the SQL patch called 'Permission_Keys.sql' located in this
     folder. One way to do this is using:
      
     mysql -u <username> -p <database> < Permission_Keys.sql
     
  2. Open the SAHARA Labs WI configuration file (config.ini) and modify the 
     following properties to have:
     
   * permkey.enable = true ; Enable permission keys.
   * database.adapter = Pdo_Mysql ; Database driver.
   * database.params.host = 127.0.0.1 ; Database address.
   * database.params.dbname = sahara ; Database name.
   * database.params.username = sahara ; The database connection user name.
                                     ; This user only requires 'SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE'
                                     ; privileges.
   * database.params.password = saharapasswd ; The database connection 
                                     ; password.
 
  3. Test the permission keys. If after the permission key has been entered and 
     the page appears to be hung on 'Please wait...', it may mean the database 
     is incorrectly configured.
